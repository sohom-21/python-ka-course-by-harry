## 📚 Overview

This repository documents my comprehensive Python learning journey, from fundamental concepts to advanced applications in data science and analytics. It contains a structured progression of code examples, practice exercises, and mini-projects that demonstrate my growing proficiency in Python programming.

## 🎯 Learning Path

### 🔹 Fundamentals
- **Basic Syntax & Data Types**: Variables, strings, numbers, booleans
- **Control Structures**: Conditionals, loops, and flow control
- **Data Structures**: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- **Functions**: Parameters, recursion, lambda functions

### 🔹 Intermediate Concepts
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance
- **File Handling**: Reading, writing, and manipulating files
- **Error Handling**: Try-except blocks and exception handling
- **List Comprehensions**: Elegant ways to create and transform lists

### 🔹 Advanced Topics
- **Data Analytics**: Using NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation
- **Data Science**: Machine learning foundations with PyTorch
- **GUI Development**: Creating interfaces with Tkinter
- **Web Development**: Introduction to Django
