Here is a random text of 80 lines:

The old clock ticked a dusty rhythm.
Blue socks lay forgotten on the chair.
A bird sang a hurried, bright tune outside.
The coffee pot hissed softly.
Shadows stretched long across the floor.
Paper fluttered from an open window.
Someone whispered a secret name.
Raindrops painted patterns on the glass.
A singular thought drifted by.
Empty shelves awaited new stories.
The smell of cut grass filled the air.
Silence settled, thick and warm.
Keys jingled somewhere down the hall.
A forgotten melody played in the mind.
Dust motes danced in a sunbeam.
The road curved out of sight.
A single flower bloomed unexpectedly.
Colors bled together in a blurred vision.
The wind sighed through the leaves.
Pages turned themselves in a breeze.
A distant train whistle blew.
Smooth stones felt cool to the touch.
Words tangled on the tongue.
The sky turned a pale, washed-out grey.
Something shifted in the darkness.
A lost button rolled under the sofa.
The taste of rain was on the lips.
Footprints vanished in the sand.
A question hung unanswered.
The hum of electricity filled the quiet.
Cobwebs glistened like spun silver.
A memory surfaced, clear and sharp.
The door creaked open just a crack.
Sunlight painted the wall gold.
Heavy curtains blocked the view.
A whispered promise was lost.
The air felt thin and cold.
Rough bark scratched against the hand.
Numbers blurred into meaningless shapes.
The reflection in the water wavered.
A sudden laugh broke the stillness.
Empty space yawned wide.
The scent of old paper lingered.
A tiny insect crawled across the table.
Footsteps echoed in an empty room.
The edge of the world seemed near.
A half-finished drawing lay abandoned.
The sound of waves crashed far away.
Something heavy settled in the chest.
A single star appeared in the twilight.
The pattern on the wallpaper swam.
A forgotten tune played on repeat.
Dust gathered silently in corners.
The light faded slowly.
A bird call pierced the air.
Threads unravelled at the seam.
The scent of rain was on the wind.
Blurred faces passed in a crowd.
A single tear rolled down a cheek.
The distant hills were shrouded in mist.
Rough hands held a smooth stone.
Words formed silently in the mind.
The sky was a vast, indifferent blue.
Something moved just out of sight.
A broken clock showed the wrong time.
The taste of dust was in the mouth.
Footprints filled with water.
A question dissolved in the air.
The hum of a refrigerator was constant.
Cobwebs felt like forgotten history.
A memory faded like old ink.
The door remained stubbornly shut.
Sunlight warmed the skin.
Thin light filtered through the blinds.
A forgotten name surfaced.
The air felt thick and humid.
Smooth wood felt cool.
Letters blurred into abstract art.
The reflection was distorted.
